# DevOps Escape Room Workshop Script
## "Operation Deploy the Python" - 20 Minutes
### **For Streamlit Developers - Detailed Version**

---

## Opening & Introduction (5 minutes)

**"Welcome everyone! I'm excited to take you through our DevOps Escape Room adventure today. But first, let me ask you something - raise your hand if you've ever built a Streamlit app and then struggled to get it running on someone else's computer - I see most of you! That's exactly what we're going to solve today."**

**"But before we dive into the game, I need to explain something fundamental that many new developers don't understand: what does 'deployment' actually mean?"**

**"Right now, when you run `streamlit run app.py` on your computer, you see something like:**
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://192.168.1.100:8501
```

**"This means your app is running on YOUR computer, and only people on your local network can see it. But what if you want to:**
- Show your app to a friend who lives in another city?
- Put your app on your portfolio website so employers can see it?
- Share your app with your team for a group project?
- Make your app available 24/7 so users can access it anytime?

**"That's where 'deployment' comes in. Let me break this down step by step:"**

### **STEP 1: What is deployment?**
*"Deployment is the process of taking your code from your computer and putting it on a server (a computer that's always connected to the internet) so other people can access it through a web browser."*

**"Think of it like this:**
- **Your computer** = Your kitchen (where you cook)
- **Deployment** = Opening a restaurant (where customers can eat your food)
- **The server** = The restaurant building (always open, always accessible)

### **STEP 2: Why is deployment hard?**
*"When you run your Streamlit app locally, everything just works because:*
- *Your computer has Python installed*
- *Your computer has all the libraries you need*
- *Your computer knows where your files are*
- *Your computer has the right permissions*

*"But when you try to put your app on a server, you're asking a completely different computer to run your code. That computer might:*
- *Have a different version of Python*
- *Be missing some libraries*
- *Have different file paths*
- *Have different security settings*

### **STEP 3: What problems do you face?**
*"Here are the most common problems new developers encounter:*

#### **Problem 1: The 'It Works on My Machine' Problem**
*"Your app works perfectly on your computer, but when you try to deploy it, it fails. This happens because the server environment is different from your local environment."*

#### **Problem 2: The Dependency Nightmare**
*"Your app needs specific libraries (pandas, plotly, scikit-learn, etc.), but the server doesn't have them installed. You need to tell the server exactly what to install."*

#### **Problem 3: The File Path Problem**
*"Your app looks for files in specific locations on your computer, but those locations don't exist on the server."*

#### **Problem 4: The Secret Problem**
*"Your app uses API keys or database passwords, but you can't just put them in your code because then everyone can see them."*

#### **Problem 5: The Update Problem**
*"Every time you want to update your app, you have to manually rebuild and redeploy it. This is time-consuming and error-prone."*

### **STEP 4: What is DevOps?**
*"DevOps is the set of practices and tools that solve these deployment problems. It's like having a toolkit that makes deployment:*
- *Consistent (works the same way every time)*
- *Automated (happens automatically when you push code)*
- *Reliable (catches problems before they reach users)*
- *Scalable (can handle lots of users)*

### **STEP 5: What will you learn today?**
*"Today, we're going to play through 'Operation Deploy the Python' - a fun, interactive way to learn these DevOps concepts. You'll learn:*

#### **Mission 1: Dockerfile Jigsaw**
*"How to package your Streamlit app with everything it needs to run anywhere. It's like creating a lunchbox with everything your app needs."*

#### **Mission 2: Cache Crash**
*"How to make your deployments faster and smaller. Because nobody wants to wait 10 minutes for their app to deploy!"*

#### **Mission 3: Pipeline Architect**
*"How to automate testing and deployment. Push code → tests run → if tests pass → app deploys automatically."*

#### **Mission 4: Log Detective**
*"How to debug when things go wrong. When your app breaks, logs tell you exactly what happened."*

#### **Mission 5: Deploy or Die**
*"How to configure production deployment with secrets, environment variables, and rollback strategies."*

#### **Mission 6: Outage Simulator**
*"How to respond when your live app breaks. Because things break, and you need to know how to fix them fast."*

**"Here's what makes this special:**
- **Hands-on learning** - You'll actually click, drag, and configure things
- **Streamlit-focused scenarios** - Every mission is based on problems you'll face when sharing your Streamlit apps
- **Progressive difficulty** - We start simple and build up step by step
- **Instant feedback** - You'll know immediately if you're on the right track
- **Real-world skills** - These are the exact techniques used by professional developers

**"By the end of this workshop, you'll understand:**
- *Why deployment is hard*
- *How to solve common deployment problems*
- *How to automate your deployment process*
- *How to debug when things go wrong*
- *How to deploy with confidence*

**"This isn't just theory - these are practical skills you can use immediately for your Streamlit projects."**

## Key Concepts Explanation (4 minutes)

**"Before we start the missions, let me explain the three most important concepts you'll encounter today: Dockerfiles, Containers, and CI/CD."**

### **CONCEPT 1: What is a Dockerfile?**
*"A Dockerfile is like a recipe for your Streamlit app. It's a text file that tells Docker exactly how to build your app. Think of it like this:*

**"Your Streamlit app recipe (Dockerfile):**
```
1. Start with Python 3.12 (FROM python:3.12-slim)
2. Create a workspace folder (WORKDIR /app)
3. Copy the list of ingredients (COPY requirements.txt .)
4. Install all ingredients (RUN pip install -r requirements.txt)
5. Copy your app files (COPY . .)
6. Start cooking (CMD streamlit run app.py)
```

**"Why do you need a Dockerfile?**
- *It ensures your app runs the same way everywhere*
- *It packages everything your app needs*
- *It makes deployment consistent and reliable*

### **CONCEPT 2: What is a Container?**
*"A container is like a shipping container for your app. Here's how it works:*

**"Think of a shipping container:**
- *It's standardized (same size, same shape)*
- *It's portable (works on ships, trucks, trains)*
- *It's self-contained (everything inside is protected)*
- *It's consistent (same container works everywhere)*

**"A Docker container is the same thing for your Streamlit app:**
- *It's standardized (same environment every time)*
- *It's portable (works on any computer with Docker)*
- *It's self-contained (includes everything your app needs)*
- *It's consistent (runs the same way everywhere)*

**"What's inside a container?**
- *Your Streamlit app code*
- *Python interpreter*
- *All required libraries (pandas, streamlit, etc.)*
- *System dependencies*
- *Configuration files*

**"Why use containers?**
- *Solves the 'it works on my machine' problem*
- *Makes deployment predictable*
- *Isolates your app from other apps*
- *Makes scaling easier*

### **CONCEPT 3: What is CI/CD?**
*"CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Let me break this down:*

#### **Continuous Integration (CI):**
*"This means every time you push code to GitHub, it automatically:*
- *Runs tests to make sure your code works*
- *Checks code quality*
- *Builds your app*
- *Catches problems before they reach users*

#### **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
*"This means if all tests pass, it automatically:*
- *Deploys your app to the server*
- *Makes it available to users*
- *No manual work required*

**"Here's how CI/CD works in practice:**
1. **You write code** for your Streamlit app
2. **You push to GitHub** (git push origin main)
3. **CI/CD pipeline automatically starts** (like a robot waking up)
4. **Tests run** (checking if your code works)
5. **If tests pass** → Build Docker container
6. **If build succeeds** → Deploy to server
7. **If deployment succeeds** → Your app is live!

**"Why is CI/CD important?**
- *Catches bugs before they reach users*
- *Makes deployment automatic and reliable*
- *Saves time (no manual deployment work)*
- *Makes updates faster and safer*
- *Gives you confidence to deploy frequently*

**"Let me show you a real example. Imagine you're working on a Streamlit app that shows stock prices. Here's what happens with CI/CD:**

#### **Without CI/CD:**
1. You write code
2. You test locally
3. You manually build Docker image
4. You manually deploy to server
5. You manually check if it works
6. If something breaks, you manually fix it

#### **With CI/CD:**
1. You write code
2. You push to GitHub
3. Everything else happens automatically!

**"This is like having a personal assistant that handles all the boring deployment work for you."**

**"Now that you understand these concepts, let's see them in action through our missions!"**

## Website Navigation & Setup (2 minutes)

**"Now let's get everyone set up. Please navigate to [your website URL] in your browser."**

**"You'll see our beautiful landing page with the rocket emoji and 'Operation Deploy the Python' title. This is where you'll choose your challenge level and enter your name."**

**"Let me walk you through the difficulty levels:**
- **Beginner** - Perfect if you're new to deployment. You'll get lots of hints and simple challenges. Think of this as having training wheels on.
- **Intermediate** - If you've tried deploying before but want to learn about automation. This is like riding a bike with some support.
- **Advanced** - For those who want to tackle production-level deployment. This is like riding a motorcycle - fast and powerful but requires skill.

**"Go ahead and enter your name - make it fun! I'll wait while everyone gets set up."**

**[Wait for everyone to complete setup]**

**"Great! Now you should see your mission dashboard. Notice how it shows your progress, difficulty level, and the 6 missions we'll complete. Each mission builds on the previous one, so we'll work through them sequentially."**

**"Look at the mission cards - they show you exactly what you'll learn in each mission. Notice how they're color-coded: green for completed, blue for unlocked, and gray for locked missions."**

**"Before we start, let me explain what we're about to do. We're going to simulate the entire deployment process that professional developers use. You'll learn the same tools and techniques that companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Google use to deploy their applications."**

---

## Mission 1: Dockerfile Jigsaw (4 minutes)

**"Let's start with Mission 1 - Dockerfile Jigsaw. Click on Mission 1 to see the intro screen."**

**"This mission teaches you about Dockerfiles - the recipe for your Streamlit app that we just discussed."**

**"Remember, a Dockerfile is like a recipe that tells Docker exactly how to build your app. Let me explain each step in detail:"**

### **WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOU AS STREAMLIT DEVELOPERS:**

#### **Scenario 1: The Streamlit Sharing Problem**
*"You've built an awesome Streamlit app - maybe a data visualization dashboard or a machine learning predictor. You want to show your friend, so you send them the code. But they can't run it because:*
- *They have Python 3.9 but you used Python 3.12*
- *They're missing libraries like pandas, plotly, or scikit-learn*
- *They're on Windows but you developed on Mac*
- *Their pip is outdated and can't install your requirements*

*"With Docker, you can send them one file (a Dockerfile) and your Streamlit app will work on their computer exactly like it does on yours!"*

#### **Scenario 2: The Streamlit Cloud Deployment**
*"You want to deploy your Streamlit app to Streamlit Cloud, but it keeps failing because:*
- *Dependency conflicts between libraries*
- *Missing system packages*
- *Version mismatches*

*"With a proper Dockerfile, you can ensure your app runs consistently in the cloud just like it does locally."*

#### **Scenario 3: The Group Project Nightmare**
*"You're working on a Streamlit project with classmates. Everyone's computer is set up differently:*
- *Different Python versions*
- *Different operating systems*
- *Missing libraries*
- *Different package managers*

*"Instead of spending hours helping each other install the right packages, you can use Docker so everyone runs the exact same Streamlit environment."*

**"Now click 'Start Mission' to begin the interactive game."**

**[Walk through the game mechanics in detail]**

**"You'll see instruction blocks that you need to drag and drop into the correct order. Think of it like following a recipe for your Streamlit app:"**

**"Let me explain each step in detail:"**

#### **1. FROM python:3.12-slim**
*"This is like choosing your base ingredients. You're saying 'I want to start with Python 3.12, but make it slim (smaller) so it loads faster.' This is your foundation. The 'slim' version is smaller because it doesn't include development tools, documentation, and other things you don't need for running apps."*

#### **2. WORKDIR /app**
*"This sets up your workspace - like creating a folder called 'app' where all your files will live. It's like saying 'everything goes in this specific folder.' This is important because it ensures your files are in the right place."*

#### **3. COPY requirements.txt .**
*"This copies your requirements.txt file (the list of libraries your Streamlit app needs) into the container. It's like copying your shopping list into your kitchen. This file tells Docker exactly what libraries to install."*

#### **4. RUN pip install -r requirements.txt**
*"This actually installs all the libraries from your requirements.txt. It's like going shopping and buying all the ingredients on your list. This step downloads and installs pandas, streamlit, plotly, etc."*

#### **5. COPY . .**
*"This copies all your Streamlit app files (app.py, any data files, etc.) into the container. It's like bringing all your cooking tools and ingredients into the kitchen. This includes your actual Python code."*

#### **6. CMD streamlit run app.py**
*"This tells the container how to start your Streamlit app. It's like saying 'now cook the meal using this recipe.' This is the command that starts your app when the container runs."*

**"Try dragging the blocks around. Notice how the game gives you hints and validates your solution in real-time. This teaches you the proper order for creating these magic boxes for your Streamlit apps!"**

**[Let them work for 2-3 minutes, then ask]**

**"Who got it right on the first try? Who needed a hint? That's totally normal - this is a skill that takes practice!"**

**"Let me show you why order matters. If you copy your code BEFORE installing requirements, every time you change your code, Docker has to reinstall all the libraries. But if you install requirements first, Docker can reuse that step and only rebuild the parts that changed."**

**"This is called 'layer caching' and it's one of the most important concepts in Docker. It can make your builds 10x faster!"**

---

## Mission 2: Cache Crash (4 minutes)

**"Excellent! Now let's move to Mission 2 - Cache Crash. This builds on what you just learned but focuses on making your Streamlit app deployments faster and smaller."**

**"Click on Mission 2 and read the intro. This mission teaches you about making your Docker builds faster and smaller for Streamlit apps."**

**"Let me explain why optimization matters. When you build a Docker image, it creates 'layers' - think of them like layers of a cake. Each instruction in your Dockerfile creates a new layer. Docker is smart - if a layer hasn't changed, it reuses it instead of rebuilding it."**

**"Here's how layer caching works:**
1. **Layer 1**: Install Python (rarely changes)
2. **Layer 2**: Install system packages (rarely changes)
3. **Layer 3**: Install Python libraries (changes when you add new libraries)
4. **Layer 4**: Copy your code (changes every time you modify your app)

**"If you change your code, Docker only rebuilds Layer 4. If you add a new library, Docker rebuilds Layers 3 and 4. If you change the base image, Docker rebuilds everything."**

### **WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOU AS STREAMLIT DEVELOPERS:**

#### **Scenario 1: The Slow Streamlit Development**
*"You're working on your Streamlit app and every time you make a small change to your code, you have to wait 5 minutes for everything to rebuild and redeploy. It's frustrating and slows you down. Here's what's happening:*
- *You change one line in app.py*
- *Docker rebuilds everything from scratch*
- *It reinstalls pandas, streamlit, plotly, etc.*
- *It copies all your files again*
- *Finally it starts your app*

*"With proper optimization, that same change rebuilds in 30 seconds because Docker reuses the unchanged layers!"*

#### **Scenario 2: The Streamlit Cloud Size Limit**
*"Your Streamlit app Docker image is huge - like 2GB! Streamlit Cloud has size limits and your app won't deploy. Here's why it might be big:*
- *Using python:3.12 instead of python:3.12-slim (saves ~500MB)*
- *Not cleaning up after installing packages*
- *Including unnecessary files like .git folders*

*"With optimization, you can make it much smaller - maybe 200MB - so it fits within the free tier limits."*

#### **Scenario 3: The Heroku Deployment Problem**
*"You want to deploy your Streamlit app to Heroku, but it's too big for the free tier. Heroku's free tier has strict limits:*
- *512MB RAM limit*
- *500MB slug size limit*
- *Sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity*

*"With optimization, you can make it small enough to deploy for free!"*

**"The key insight: Docker remembers what it built before and reuses unchanged parts. If you organize things correctly, it only rebuilds what actually changed in your Streamlit app."**

**"In this game, you'll optimize a Dockerfile to hit specific size and time targets. You'll learn about:"**

#### **1. Using smaller base images**
*"python:3.12-slim vs python:3.12 - the slim version is much smaller because it doesn't include development tools, documentation, and other things you don't need for running apps."*

#### **2. Copying requirements.txt before your Streamlit code**
*"This is crucial! If you copy requirements.txt first, then install packages, then copy your code, changes to your code don't trigger a reinstall of all packages."*

#### **3. Using optimization flags**
*"Like --no-cache-dir for pip, which prevents pip from storing downloaded packages (saves space), or --no-install-recommends for apt-get."*

#### **4. Ignoring unnecessary files**
*"Create a .dockerignore file to exclude things like .git folders, __pycache__, .env files, etc."*

**"Try to hit the targets! The game will show you real-time feedback on build time and image size. This is exactly how you'd optimize your Streamlit app deployments!"**

**[Let them work for 2-3 minutes, then discuss]**

**"What strategies did you use? Did anyone discover that copying requirements.txt first makes a huge difference? This is a real optimization that can cut your Streamlit app build times from 5 minutes to 30 seconds!"**

**"Let me show you a real example. A typical unoptimized Dockerfile might look like this:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD streamlit run app.py
```

**"An optimized version would be:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD streamlit run app.py
```

**"The optimized version is faster, smaller, and more reliable!"**

---

## Mission 3: Pipeline Architect (4 minutes)

**"Now we're getting into something really cool - Mission 3: Pipeline Architect. This teaches you about CI/CD pipelines for your Streamlit apps."**

**"Remember what we learned about CI/CD? A pipeline is like having a robot assistant that automatically tests your Streamlit app and puts it online when you're ready. No more manual deployment work!"**

**"Let me explain what CI/CD means:**
- **CI (Continuous Integration)** - Every time you push code, it automatically runs tests
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)** - If tests pass, it automatically deploys your app

**"Here's how a typical pipeline works:**
1. **You push code** to GitHub
2. **Pipeline automatically starts** (like a robot waking up)
3. **Tests run** (checking if your code works)
4. **If tests pass** → Build Docker image
5. **If build succeeds** → Deploy to server
6. **If deployment succeeds** → Your app is live!

**"This happens automatically every time you push code. No more manual work!"**

### **WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOU AS STREAMLIT DEVELOPERS:**

#### **Scenario 1: The Forgotten Streamlit Update**
*"You finish adding a new feature to your Streamlit app - maybe a new chart or a machine learning model. You push it to GitHub, but forget to actually update the live version. Your users can't see your cool new feature! With a pipeline, your Streamlit app automatically updates when you push code."*

#### **Scenario 2: The Broken Streamlit App**
*"You're working on a Streamlit project and someone pushes code that breaks the app. Without automated testing, you don't find out until users complain. Here's what could go wrong:*
- *Syntax errors in your Streamlit code*
- *Missing imports*
- *Logic errors that crash the app*
- *Dependency conflicts*

*"With a pipeline, it catches problems immediately before they reach users."*

#### **Scenario 3: The Manual Testing Nightmare**
*"Every time you want to update your live Streamlit app, you have to:*
- *Test it locally*
- *Build the Docker image*
- *Push to a registry*
- *Deploy to your hosting platform*
- *Check if it's working*

*"It's boring and you might forget steps. A pipeline does all this automatically!"*

#### **Scenario 4: The Streamlit App Confidence**
*"You're nervous about updating your live Streamlit app because you might break it for users. With a pipeline, you can test everything automatically before it goes live, so you can update with confidence!"*

**"In this game, you'll design a complete pipeline by connecting job nodes and configuring settings. You'll learn the typical flow for Streamlit apps:"**

#### **1. Test - Run your Streamlit app tests automatically**
*"This might include:*
- *Unit tests for your functions*
- *Integration tests for your Streamlit components*
- *Data validation tests*
- *API endpoint tests (if your app uses APIs)*

#### **2. Lint - Check your Python code for common mistakes**
*"Tools like flake8 or black check for:*
- *Code style issues*
- *Potential bugs*
- *Unused imports*
- *Long lines*

#### **3. Build - Create your Streamlit app Docker image**
*"This builds your Docker image using the optimized Dockerfile we learned about in Mission 2."*

#### **4. Push - Upload to a registry**
*"This uploads your Docker image to a registry like Docker Hub, so it can be deployed anywhere."*

#### **5. Deploy - Put your Streamlit app online automatically**
*"This deploys your app to your hosting platform (Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, AWS, etc.)"*

**"Drag the job nodes to connect them in the right order, then configure each job. Notice how jobs depend on each other - tests must pass before building, building must succeed before deploying your Streamlit app."**

**[Let them work for 2-3 minutes]**

**"This is exactly how real Streamlit projects work. When you push code, this entire pipeline runs automatically. It catches bugs before they reach users and ensures your Streamlit app is always ready to go online!"**

**"Let me show you what a real pipeline looks like. Here's a simple GitHub Actions workflow for a Streamlit app:**
```yaml
name: Deploy Streamlit App
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: pytest
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: docker build -t myapp .
      - run: docker push myapp
      - run: # deploy to your platform
```

---

## Mission 4: Log Detective (3 minutes)

**"Mission 4: Log Detective - this is where you learn to be a Streamlit app detective! When something goes wrong with your deployment, you need to figure out what happened."**

**"Logs are like a diary that records everything your Streamlit app does. When something breaks, logs tell you exactly what went wrong and where."**

**"Let me explain what logs look like. When you run `streamlit run app.py`, you see output like:**
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://192.168.1.100:8501
```

**"But when something goes wrong, you might see:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data.csv'
ImportError: cannot import name 'st' from 'streamlit'
```

### **WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOU AS STREAMLIT DEVELOPERS:**

#### **Scenario 1: The Streamlit Cloud Deployment Failure**
*"Your Streamlit app works locally but fails when you try to deploy it to Streamlit Cloud. Instead of guessing what's wrong, you can read the deployment logs to see exactly what error occurred and fix it quickly. Common issues include:*
- *Missing dependencies in requirements.txt*
- *Wrong file paths*
- *Import errors*
- *Port conflicts*

#### **Scenario 2: The Missing Library Error**
*"Your Streamlit app crashes with 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotly''. The logs show you exactly which library is missing so you can add it to your requirements.txt. This is much faster than guessing!"*

#### **Scenario 3: The Port Configuration Problem**
*"Your Streamlit app won't start because it's trying to use port 8501 when it's already taken. The logs show you the exact error so you can fix the port configuration."*

**"In this game, you'll analyze simulated logs to identify errors common in Streamlit deployments. Look for:"**

#### **1. Missing modules (like forgetting to add plotly to requirements.txt)**
*"Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotly'*
*"Solution: Add plotly to requirements.txt"*

#### **2. Wrong file paths (like looking for app.py in the wrong directory)**
*"Error: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'app.py'*
*"Solution: Check your file structure"*

#### **3. Port conflicts (like Streamlit trying to use port 8501 when it's busy)**
*"Error: OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use*
*"Solution: Kill the process using the port or use a different port"*

#### **4. Import errors (like syntax errors in your Streamlit code)**
*"Error: ImportError: cannot import name 'st' from 'streamlit'*
*"Solution: Check your import statements"*

#### **5. Environment problems (like wrong Python version)**
*"Error: This package requires Python 3.8 or higher*
*"Solution: Update your Python version"*

**"This is a crucial skill - when your Streamlit app breaks, you don't want to be guessing what went wrong. You want to read the logs, find the error, fix it, and get back to coding!"**

**[Let them work for 2 minutes]**

**"Who found the missing 'requests' module? That's a classic error - your Streamlit app tries to use the requests library but it's not in requirements.txt. This happens all the time with Streamlit apps!"**

**"Let me show you how to read logs effectively:**
1. **Look for ERROR or FAILED** - These indicate what went wrong
2. **Check the stack trace** - This shows exactly where the error occurred
3. **Look for common patterns** - Missing modules, file not found, etc.
4. **Check the context** - What was happening when the error occurred?"

---

## Mission 5: Deploy or Die (3 minutes)

**"Mission 5: Deploy or Die - the final step! This teaches you how to put your Streamlit app online for real users."**

**"Deployment is taking your Streamlit app and making it available on the internet where people can actually use it. You need to configure:**
- Where to store your app (registry URLs like Docker Hub)
- What version to use (image tags)
- Secret information (like API keys for your Streamlit app)
- How to update your app safely (deployment strategies)

### **WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOU AS STREAMLIT DEVELOPERS:**

#### **Scenario 1: The Streamlit Portfolio Showcase**
*"You've built an amazing Streamlit app - maybe a data science project or a machine learning dashboard. You want to show it off in your portfolio. You need to put it online so employers can actually see it working. Proper deployment makes this easy and professional!"*

#### **Scenario 2: The API Key Security Problem**
*"You accidentally put your API key in your Streamlit code and pushed it to GitHub. Now everyone can see your secret! Proper deployment teaches you how to keep secrets safe using environment variables or Streamlit's st.secrets."*

#### **Scenario 3: The Streamlit App Update Disaster**
*"You update your live Streamlit app and it breaks. Users can't access it anymore! Proper deployment includes ways to quickly go back to the working version."*

#### **Scenario 4: The Traffic Surge**
*"Your Streamlit app goes viral and gets lots of visitors. Without proper deployment, it crashes under the load. Good deployment includes ways to handle lots of users!"*

**"Let me explain the key concepts:"**

#### **1. Registry URLs - Where your Docker images are stored**
*"Think of this like a warehouse where you store your packaged apps. Popular options include:*
- *Docker Hub (docker.io/yourusername/yourapp)*
- *GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io/yourusername/yourapp)*
- *AWS ECR, Google Container Registry, etc.*

#### **2. Image tags - Versioning your app**
*"Like version numbers for your app:*
- *latest (always the newest version)*
- *v1.0.0 (specific version)*
- *main-abc123 (commit-based versioning)*

#### **3. Environment variables - Keeping secrets safe**
*"Instead of hardcoding API keys in your code, use environment variables:*
```python
# Bad
api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"

# Good
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
```

#### **4. Deployment strategies - How to update your app safely**
- *Rolling deployment (update gradually)*
- *Blue-green deployment (switch between two versions)*
- *Canary deployment (test with small group first)*

**"Fill in the deployment configuration forms with the correct values. This is exactly what you'd do when putting your Streamlit app online with services like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS."**

**[Let them work for 2 minutes]**

**"Notice how you need to think about keeping API keys safe (using st.secrets), separating different environments (like testing vs live), and having a plan for when things go wrong. These aren't just advanced concepts - they're essential for any real Streamlit project!"**

**"Let me show you a real example. Here's how you'd configure a Streamlit app for deployment:**
```python
# In your Streamlit app
import streamlit as st
import os

# Get API key from environment variable
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")

# Or use Streamlit secrets
api_key = st.secrets["API_KEY"]

# Your app code here
st.title("My Streamlit App")
```

## Mission 6: Outage Simulator (3 minutes)

**"Final mission: Outage Simulator - incident response! This is what you do when your live Streamlit app breaks."**

**"Things break - it's normal! What matters is how fast you can fix them and get your Streamlit app working again."**

**"Let me explain what incident response means. When your app breaks, you need to:**
1. **Assess** - What's broken and how bad is it?
2. **Choose strategy** - How do we fix it?
3. **Execute** - Actually fix it
4. **Verify** - Make sure it's working
5. **Learn** - How do we prevent this in the future?

### **WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOU AS STREAMLIT DEVELOPERS:**

#### **Scenario 1: The Demo Day Disaster**
*"You're presenting your Streamlit app to potential employers and it crashes during your demo. You need to fix it quickly to save your presentation! Good incident response skills help you stay calm and fix things fast."*

#### **Scenario 2: The User Complaint**
*"Someone emails you saying your Streamlit app isn't working. Instead of panicking, you can systematically check what's wrong and fix it. This makes you look professional and reliable."*

#### **Scenario 3: The Streamlit Cloud Outage**
*"Your Streamlit app is down and users are complaining. You need to quickly decide whether to rollback to a previous version or try to fix the current one."*

#### **Scenario 4: The Learning Experience**
*"Every time something breaks, you learn something new about Streamlit deployment. Good incident response includes figuring out why it broke so you can prevent it from happening again."*

**"In this game, you'll respond to a Streamlit app incident by choosing the right recovery strategy:"**

#### **1. Rollback - Safe but slow, go back to the last working version of your Streamlit app**
*"This is like pressing Ctrl+Z for your entire app. It's safe because you know the previous version worked, but it's slow because you have to redeploy everything."*

#### **2. Hotfix - Risky but fast, make a quick fix to your Streamlit code**
*"This is like putting a band-aid on a broken bone. It might work temporarily, but you need to be careful not to make things worse."*

#### **3. Redeploy - Medium risk, deploy a tested fix**
*"This is like going to the doctor. It takes longer than a band-aid, but it's more likely to actually fix the problem."*

**"Monitor your Streamlit app's health and choose your response based on the situation. This teaches you systematic problem-solving - assess, choose strategy, execute, verify, learn."**

**[Let them work for 2 minutes]**

**"This is real-world problem-solving for Streamlit apps. When your app breaks, you need to make these decisions quickly and confidently!"**

**"Let me show you what a real incident response looks like:**
1. **Alert comes in** - "App is down!"
2. **Check monitoring** - Look at logs, metrics, user reports
3. **Assess impact** - How many users affected? How critical is the app?
4. **Choose strategy** - Rollback, hotfix, or redeploy?
5. **Execute** - Actually fix the problem
6. **Verify** - Test that the fix works
7. **Communicate** - Let users know what happened
8. **Post-mortem** - Learn from the incident"
